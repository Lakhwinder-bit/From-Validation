!Form Validation Using JavaScript

This project demonstrates a simple yet effective form validation system built using vanilla JavaScript. The validation checks the following:

Email Validation: Ensures that the entered email follows the correct format (e.g., example@gmail.com) and contains at least 5 characters before the @ symbol.

Password Validation: Ensures the password includes:

At least one uppercase letter

At least one lowercase letter

At least one number

At least one special character (@$!%*?&)

Minimum length of 8 characters

Features:

Real-time error messages for incorrect input.

Clear previous errors on every form submission.

Displays a success message when all validations pass.

No external libraries required â€” purely JavaScript.

Tech Stack:

HTML (Form Structure)

CSS (Styling for messages)

JavaScript (Validation Logic)
